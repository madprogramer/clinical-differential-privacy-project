1. Say hi ask new years
2. Show GitHub repo
3. Explain diffpriv briefly (Discrete Laplace, also learn how to optimize sensitivity LARGEST POSSIBLE DIFFERENCE OF RUNNING PROBLEM ON TEO DATASETS, you can find epsilon from sensitivity or vice versa. Look more into sensitivity sampling before continuing but also think about fixing sensitivity and estimating epsilon and scale instead. OpenGP)
4. Python or R (OpenDP is maintained, diffpriv is not; What is a possibility is to export data to Pythony format)
5. What is Quarto
6. Show quarto notebook
7. Go over info slides
8. Get to method and explain johan table, RA patients on different medications. How their condition improves over the course of 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.
9. DP for a function (Differential Privacy assumption: It assumes if SI is correlated to something else, it is still considered “private” under DP because variable-independence is assumed, see notes in notebook)
10. DP for identity (what is identity? Because you take multivariate data but only output change to the age column. I am “replacing” an age 50+ patient with an age “50-“ one. Geo-indistinguishability is a good place to start from to understand the language. Two patients at a distance (of age). D and D’, try to map to theoretical framework)
11. What next? Bias right? focus on sex and later age, perhaps? We can compare remission improvement as distributed by age. Survival analysis may be relevant! Have a loop to conduct multiple trial simulations.
12. Overleaf? We have to build a theoretical framework over time. Keep a lookout for the project agreement deadline :} ad-hock meeting after 27th 1PM.
With Niels:
1. Present everything as part of ScandRA and as collaboration with universities
2.
