## **Outline**

-   Patient Data Confidentiality: Dilemma or Opportunity?

-   What is Differential Privacy?

-   Benefits of Differential Privacy

-   Challenges of Differential Privacy in a Clinical Setting

## Patient Data Confidentiality

**Patient data confidentiality** is the ethical and legal obligation to protect patient information.

-   This data includes **medical records**, **test results**, and **personal information**

-   It is a continuous process involving **access control authorization** and **encryption**.

## **Risks of Having Weak Patient Data Confidentiality**

-   **Identity theft** and **fraud**

-   **Privacy violations**

-   **Financial losses**

-   **Potentially illegal**

Clearly, we always want to have some level of confidentiality. But...

## **Limits of a Closed Research Environment**

**Data Confidentiality** puts the researcher into a **closed research environment**. A **closed environment** brings several serious caveats.

-   **Limited access** to resources and data

-   **Restricted collaboration** with external experts

-   **Difficult to replicate** results

## **What is Differential Privacy?**

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{R}
1 + 1
```

```{r}
1 + 1
```
